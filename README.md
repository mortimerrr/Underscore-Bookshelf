#### Underscore Bookshelf

A practice in JavaScript, JQuery and Underscore.js we did at the Full-Stack Ruby Web Development course at We Got Coders (wegotcoders.com).  

We've sent out a request for 'Harry Potter' to the Google Books API.  
We took the response, iterated through each book object, extracted the thumbnail photos of the books and  
appended those to the DOM/image of the bookshelf.   
Then we have filtered the books which have received a rating or 4 or above and appended a 'hot' sticker to those books.  
Filtering the books by title is not yet finished.
